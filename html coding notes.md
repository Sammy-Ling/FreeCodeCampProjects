# Basics 


Html elements have opening and closing tags e.g opens with <h1> and closes with </h1>

H elements go from h1 to h6, indicating important such that h1 is more important than h6

P element is to create a paragraph

To add comments in html, use <!-- and -->

You can create different content areas, such as <main> </main>. Elements nested inside another element are usually indented with two spaces to show they are nested.



Images and Links



You can add images with the <img> tag, which does NOT have a closing tag

You can use '<img src=...' this will specify the location of the image, usually a url

It is always good practice to add an  alt="..."  attribute to images, just in case the image does not load

You can link to another page using the <a> element along with href="...", e.g <a href='https://hello123.com'></a>

You can also add a link between the anchor element <a> and the closing tag for </a>

If you want to turn a text into a link, add a href to the element and close them in <a> tags e.g <p>See more <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com">cat photo </a>in our gallery.</p>

You can add ' target="_blank" ' so that the link opens in a new tag



Formatting and Sections



<section> </section> to create a new section

You can add lists using the <ul> element, then using <li></li> elements within the <ul> element

<figure> element allows you to nest images with a caption and after an image, using <figcaption> allows you to put a caption to an image

You can also use <em></em> to nest words you want to emphasise and you can use <strong></strong> to make the words bold

Using <ol> you create a list that has an order to the items, make sure to still use <li> for the elements nested inside the ordered list

<form> creates a webform to collect information, make sure to add 'action' right after form to set a path such as <form action="https...."
<input> element is another way to collect data from a form
<legend> adds a caption to a fieldset

adding 'type' to any input allows you to create different attributes such as passwords or buttons etc
adding 'name' assigns a value which represents the data you are gathering, by giving radio the same name it will deselect other answers, when one is selected
adding 'placeholder' gives users a hint to what you want them to input
adding 'required' means that a user must give an answer or response before being able to submit data
adding type="radio" to an input allows for users to answer one out of many options
adding an id attribute is essential for identifying the HTML elements, it must be unique
adding 'value' specifies the value you want to send to the backend
You can also input a checkbox attitribute for multiple answer selections
adding for after the input e.g input for="..." allows you to associate the answer to certain value sent to server side

Nesting into a <label> element helps associate thetext for input element with the input itself
adding a submit element at the end allows users to click and send the data you want, by default going to form action address
You can add a textarea element to receive answers for a form with multiple lines of answer, using 'rows' and 'cols' attribute for the textarea for sizing
Placeholder attribute for the textarea gives the user a chance to see an example answer for the textarea in question

Adding the link attritube allows you to link to exteneral stylesheet or css sheets
<form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org" method="post"></form> allows you to send the information gathered to the link provided, method is the way in which you want to send the form data

Styling

vh stands for viewport height
'body' margin:0 makes no space between edge and text
'body' background-color:x changes the background colour to x
'body' color changes the text in the body

Paintings

<div class="canvas"></div> this sets a canvas for painting 
dont forget <link href> to set your CSS!
<div class="frame"> for framing a canvas/painting
css styling 'overflow:hidden' returns the size you orignally had
css sizes dont have to be just pixels (px), can be percentages e.g 25%
css styling 'filter:blur(2px)' adds a blur to the painting/canvas
css styling 'box-shadow' adds a shadow to edges to make them look more realistic
css styling 'border-radius' allows you to smooth the edges, rounding them off
css styling 'transform:rotate(0.Xdeg)' allows you to rotate to x degress, - for anticlockwise
css styling 'box-sizing:content-box' shrinks borders to accomodate content size, 'border-box' does the opposite
css styling 'font-family' changes the font style 
css styling 'text-transform' can be used to set capitals by setting it to 'uppercase'

CSS styling flexbox

flex-wrap allows for items to either shrink to fit into the boxes you created or extend outwards with nowrap
align-items allows you to align them within box
object-fit will tell the size the image to the container/box. use 'cover' to align perfectly
